# Interactive-Registration-Form

In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

I added my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

Fields with real time validation: Name, Email, Credit card number, Zip code, CVV

Fields with conditional error messages: Email (if left blank VS email entered incorrectly)
